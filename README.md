# Sol_Template_Master
My master templates I developed for use when starting new applications.

Each directory pre-aapended with 'AUTO' is an EXAMPLE configuration of my Sols_Omega_Template.

Sols_Omega_Template is my final template and older GUI templates i may not be uploading as Sols_Omega_Template is far superior, flexible, dynamic and advanced.

Sols_Omega_Template may be updated and is my final template as it enables me to make very advanced applications extremely qickly because I programmed it to program for me. Just write into the created functions, show/hide, resize if needed. Done.
